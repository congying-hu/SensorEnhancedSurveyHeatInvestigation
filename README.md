## Data
There are three dataset in the data folder: Household Indoor Sensor Measurement Data, SensorID_EPC_Survey_Open_Data, and LIMBO（Weather Station）data. 

### Household Indoor Sensor Measurement Data
This folder includes a variety of environmental parameters captured by the Smart Citizen Kits (SCK) sensors, such as air temperature, relative humidity, air quality, noise condition, and light condition.

### SensorID_EPC_Survey_Open_Data
This csv file includes the ID of the sensor, survey data conducted by TBIJ, IMD quintiles, and existing Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings.

### LIMBO (Weather Station) Data
This csv file contains outdoor weather observation data from the [Met Office](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/).
